summary: "Small implementation plans track actionable steps, progress, discoveries, and checks."

# Plans

Read the selected plan and its linked specifications before work. Update checklists and findings as work proceeds. Discuss blockers with the owner and correct assumptions when evidence changes them. Keep lasting requirements in specifications.

The plans outline implementation work for review. Implementation begins with owner approval.

Move completed implementation slices to [`archived/`](./archived/AGENTS.md). Keep unresolved follow-ups explicit rather than marking them complete. Archived plans preserve historical findings and limitations, not current implementation instructions.

Keep plans self-contained. Referenced filesystem paths must be checked in; do not cite temporary or ignored artifact locations. Summarize findings, methods, and limitations in the plan instead.

- **[archived/](./archived/AGENTS.md)** Archived plans record completed implementation slices, their checks, and historical limitations.
- **[complete-reference-algorithms](./complete-reference-algorithms.md)** Autonomously complete the remaining Merrill reference algorithm stages and recipe integrations identified by the node audit, then validate the full GPU path. _Resume this autonomous implementation pass after a checkpoint or context compaction._
- **[dng-export](./dng-export.md)** Implement uncompressed uint16 DNG export through the existing TIFF writer, with baked technical corrections and one embedded appearance; evaluate compression later.
- **[editing-optimization-handoff](./editing-optimization-handoff.md)** Continue native editing measurements with guarded GPU ownership while preserving the deferred mismatch evidence.
- **[editing-sidecars](./editing-sidecars.md)** Persist shared photographic settings in atomic versioned JSON sidecars and restore them independently of render completion.
- **[first-conversion](./first-conversion.md)** Establish the shortest Merrill X3F conversion path through the shader graph to DNG and TIFF. _Read when beginning or resuming the first end-to-end conversion._
- **[gpu-output-mismatch](./gpu-output-mismatch.md)** Intermittent GPU output differences remain unresolved, with strict regression checks and retained investigation evidence.
- **[gui-and-batch](./gui-and-batch.md)** Expose the working conversion engine through a minimal GUI and batch CLI using shared settings.
- **[photographic-help](./photographic-help.md)** Replace technical hover copy with photographic explanations, then review a small set of obvious A/B examples before expanding coverage.
- **[reference-banding-verification](./reference-banding-verification.md)** Record native Merrill banding presets, reached pixel consumers, and the remaining application-export checks.
- **[ui-responsiveness](./ui-responsiveness.md)** Measure full-quality slider feedback with active-edit input reuse, image-first replies, deferred navigator presentation, and safe supersession.
